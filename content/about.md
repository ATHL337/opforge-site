## What is OPFORGE?

**OPFORGE** stands for **Offensive Posture + FORensics + Generation & Engineering**. It's a purpose-built cybersecurity lab environment designed to:

- üõ†Ô∏è Emulate adversary behavior
- üîç Ingest and enrich telemetry from Windows and Linux endpoints
- üß† Apply explainable AI to triage and surface detections
- üìö Document real-world operator workflows

Whether you're reverse-engineering a malware sample, developing YARA rules, or building detection pipelines with SOF-ELK, OPFORGE is designed to mirror the complexity and realism of mission-ready cyber defense.

## Mission Goals

1. **Threat Emulation**
   - Use Atomic Red Team, Caldera, and custom payloads to simulate known TTPs.
   
2. **Detection Engineering**
   - Build, test, and validate detection logic using tools like Winlogbeat, Sysmon, and ELK.

3. **Explainable AI**
   - Incorporate open-source ML models for clustering, classification, and triage augmentation with transparency and traceability.

4. **Documentation**
   - Share the setup process, automation, infrastructure, and detection results in a Check‚ÄìDo‚ÄìCheck blog series.
