**OPFORGE** (Operational Forged Readiness for Generation and Emulation) is a purpose-built cyber lab and portfolio platform developed by H.Y.P.R., a senior  cyber warfare operator.

This project fuses red team emulation, detection engineering, and AI-driven analytics into a unified range built for realism, scalability, and learning impact.

## 🎯 Mission
Create a lab environment that demonstrates real-world adversary behavior and detection response — with automation, analytics, and operational rigor. OPFORGE is more than just a cyber range: it's a full-stack capability portfolio.

## 🧠 Why It Matters
Modern cyber operations demand more than checklists and tool walkthroughs. OPFORGE showcases:
- **Segmented network emulation** across red, blue, and cloud environments
- **Detection engineering pipelines** powered by Winlogbeat, Zeek, and Logstash
- **AI/ML-enhanced triage** through Jupyter, anomaly modeling, and data science
- Portfolio-grade infrastructure that mirrors real mission environments

## 🧱 What's Under the Hood
- Custom-built virtual lab using VMware Workstation Pro
- Ubuntu and Windows 10 templates, hardened and cloned
- pfSense-based segmentation: `CSOCINFRA`, `DMZRED`, `LANWORKSTATIONS`, `ADINFRA`
- Sliver, BloodHound, Impacket, Sysmon, OpenSearch, and more

## 🔁 Continuously Developed
This site documents lab builds, detection strategies, red/blue playbooks, and ML research as the lab matures toward integration with platforms like JHU APL and DOE/NNSA-aligned objectives.
