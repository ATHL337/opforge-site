description: "A complete network upgrade to support realistic cyber operations, detection engineering, and AI/ML analysis across segmented Red/Blue lanes."

## üß† Why the Upgrade?

The initial OPFORGE lab design served well for early Winlogbeat ingestion and Red Team inject testing, but lacked realistic network boundaries. As the project evolved into a threat emulation and explainable detection platform, the need for **segmented lanes**, **realistic routing**, and **better telemetry visibility** became clear.

## üß± New Subnet Architecture

| Subnet Name        | CIDR              | Purpose                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `MGMT`             | 192.168.10.0/24   | Firewall and jump host access (OOB)           |
| `CSOCINFRA`        | 192.168.20.0/24   | Logstash, OpenSearch, Jupyter, ML pipelines   |
| `ADINFRA`          | 192.168.21.0/24   | Domain controllers, core IT services          |
| `DMZRED`           | 192.168.22.0/24   | Red Team attacker infrastructure              |
| `DMZWEB`           | 192.168.23.0/24   | Decoy web servers, phishing targets           |
| `LANWORKSTATIONS`  | 192.168.30.0/24   | User systems and analyst boxes                |
| `ISOLAB`           | 192.168.40.0/24   | Malware sandbox, REMnux, FLARE workstation    |

Each subnet represents a security boundary, making traffic control and logging cleaner and more realistic.

## üîê Firewall Routing Logic (opf-fw01)

| Source ‚Üí Destination     | Default Policy         |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `DMZRED` ‚Üí `ADINFRA`     | Block (unless testing) |
| `DMZRED` ‚Üí `LANWORKSTATIONS` | Allow (inject scope)    |
| `LANWORKSTATIONS` ‚Üí `CSOCINFRA` | Allow             |
| `ISOLAB` ‚Üí Any           | Block all              |
| `MGMT` ‚Üí All             | Allow (admin access)   |
| `CSOCINFRA` ‚Üí All        | Allow (read-only/logs) |

This separation is critical for OPFORGE‚Äôs Blue Team learning, detection engineering, and Red Team emulation paths.

## üìç What's Next?

- [ ] Deploy and test each VM with correct subnet and firewall access
- [ ] Validate Winlogbeat/Sysmon output to `opf-detect01`
- [ ] Add Zeek sensors to monitor `DMZRED` and `LANWORKSTATIONS`
- [ ] Publish detection engineering rules for injected TTPs
- [ ] Build visual diagrams for full lab and include in GitHub
